The game is not without its flaws, however. Some of the common complaints include the difficulty curve, which can be too easy or too hard depending on the player's skill and preference, the lack of voice acting, which can make some of the dialog feel bland or repetitive, the occasional bugs and glitches, which can cause crashes or freezes, and the legal issues, which resulted in the game being taken down by Nintendo due to copyright infringement.
